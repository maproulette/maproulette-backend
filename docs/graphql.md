# MapRoulette GraphQL

MapRoulette's graphQL server implements a predominately read-only graphQL schema with a couple of mutations available. This is to serve as a complimentary API to the Restful API that MapRoulette currently uses. 

#### Graphiql
MapRoulette has implemented a Graphiql IDE that can be used to run queries against, you can access this at `https://\<HOST>:\<PORT>/graphqlIDE`

##### GraphQL
All graphQL queries should be executed against `https://\<HOST>:\<PORT>/graphql`
